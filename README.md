# Live Price-Magento-2
<div class="product-descr" itemprop="description"><p><a href="https://www.polacin.com/live-price.html" title="Magento 2 increase sales">Live Price (for Products on Sale) extension</a> allows to create a price counter which counts UP as time increases.<br>Seeing that our manufacture clothes and dresses. At each stage of creating our dresses there is value added and hence the quicker the client is able to secure a dress the lesser price they pay.<br>For example:<br>We start the price of a new dress at $150, as time progresses this value increases per second to say $150.001, $150.002, $150.003, $150.004, $150.005 etc<br>This would continue to increase until from the backend we would have a limit on where it would stop for the counter may stop at $200 - essentially the client has the potential to get a discount of $50 if bought early OR they may have a discount of $1 if bought really late.</p>
